## Adding a conference

All you need to do is modify [static/conferences.yaml](https://github.com/awesome-conferences/list/blob/main/static/conferences.yaml) and add your conference to the end of the file.

You don’t even need to clone the repo and do the changes there — github website interface allows you to edit the YAML file easily.

YAML syntax should be quite straightforward, but if uncertain — check [the docs](https://yaml.org).

## Contributing to the website

We welcome any contributions if they follow our standards and generally — Kant’s cathegorical imperative. However, we do retain our veto rights.

Start editing the site with:

```
git clone https://github.com/awesome-conferences/list.git
cd list
npm install
gatsby develop
```

This will run gatsby at http://localhost:8000/

### Our Standards

* We try to keep the website simple, lightweight and easy to use
